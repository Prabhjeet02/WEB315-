      At first, I used command "dotnet new blazorserver -o TodoList"  to create todo list app, then use cd TodoList.
      after that followed the todo list tutorial till end and made the groceryStore component.
      then added input and button, later i added increase and decrease buttons to the items added.
      .. added 2 pages one is FoodItems.cs and GroceryIsle.cs and define clases and properties..
      added page to nav list and icon to that page .
      added some changes and some error occur but somehow manage to get rid of them.
